Firebase Emoji Generator (Devaja JS Exercise 3)

This is an Emoji Generator based on devaja's third JS exercise with the same name.
The app is an 8x8 grid that you can draw emojis on by clicking on individual squares and they will change color.
To use the app go to https://emojigenerator-5b09d.firebaseapp.com/ and sign in with your google account.
Once you've drawn an emoji you like you can save it in the app and it will be bound to your google account.
The app also features an instant eraser that clears the whole 8x8 grid.

In the Firestore database every signed in google account gets its own collection where their emojis will be stored.

The project utilizes:
-Firebase (Hosting, Firestore)
-NodeJS
-JavaScript / JQuery
-HTML / CSS

App files:
-index.html (the main and only HTML page)
-app.js
-main.css (styling)
